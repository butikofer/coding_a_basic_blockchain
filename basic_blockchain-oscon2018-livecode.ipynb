    "**DISCLAIMER:** _All opinions, ideas, and code expressed here are my own._\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a live coding tutorial that will step you through the basic steps of building a _very_ basic blockchain written in Python. It was originally presented as a Live Coding Session at OSCON 2018 in Portland, OR. This notebook requires Python 3.7 or greater. See the accompanying `Pipfile` file for other dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are several slightly different definitions for what constitutes a blockchain, this tutorial assumes the Wikipedia definition. Paraphrased from Wikipedia: A blockchain is composed of blocks that are cryptographically linked together to form a long chain. Because each block has a cryptographic hash of the previous block we can easily verify that the chain is immutable. Blocks also contain transactions and a timestamp. The transactions record some transfer of value between parties and typically use public-key cryptography to verify the transactions' integrity. Because value transfer by way of transactions is a major use case of blockchains, they are often called \"distributed ledgers.\" (I like this moniker better than blockchain.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Blockchains derive a lot of their advantage by being decentralized in a peer-to-peer network. Because of this there needs to be a decentralized consensus algorithm so all the peers can agree on the current state of the chain that is distributed among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, a blockchain is a database that represents a ledger and has some of the following key characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cryptographically verifiable and auditable\n",
    "* Immutable\n",
    "* Implements a decentralized consensus algorithm\n",
    "* Uses a peer-to-peer network to achieve decentralization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Underlying Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting observation is that the individual technologies used in blockchain are not new. The novelty of blockchain was was the combination of this technology to solve the problems inherent in digital cash systems--_without the need for a central authority._\n",
    "\n",
    "Our basic blockchain will use the same cryptographic tech that mainstream ones do: hashing and public-key signatures. We will also use one of the most popular decentralized consensus algorithms, \"Proof-of-Work\", to show how blocks are made and shared in a distributed ledger."

    "## The Nuts and Bolts\n",
    "\n",
    "Most blockchains are built from  a core set of nuts and bolts.\n",
    "\n",
    "A blockchain has:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transactions**: These are the entries in the ledger. In our example these will describe how user X wants to send some tokens to user Y. Transactions are cryptographically signed by user X to prove that they authorize the transfer of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Blocks**: Transactions are bundled up together into a block. Depending on the blockchain, there can be hundreds or thousands of transactions in a block. The transactions are validated and then the block includes the previous block's hash, linking itself to the previous block. There is also a process called \"mining\" or \"forging\" that proves to the network of blockchain participants that this block's creation can be trusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Blockchain**: All successfully mined blocks are strung together in a big, verifiable, and immutable chain. This is the system of record--the distributed ledger.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nodes**: Computers around the world that participate in the distributed ledger network and are called \"nodes.\" They often have a full copy of the chain and are responsible for accepting transactions, making new blocks, and updating the blockchain. They communicate via the other nodes in a P2P fashion. The decentralized consensus algorithm becomes critical here to help all nodes agree on what is the definitive chain since each node is working to grow the chain. *In our simple example, we will only have one node!*\n"
